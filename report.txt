Readability:

Java: Java code tends to be more verbose compared to Scheme due to its statically typed nature and syntax. It uses curly braces and semicolons to define blocks and statements, which can make the code look cluttered to some developers.

Scheme: Scheme is known for its simplicity and elegance in syntax. It uses a minimalistic syntax with prefix notation, which can enhance readability once you get used to it. Scheme code tends to be concise and easy to understand due to its minimalistic nature.

Simplicity:

Java: Java is considered more complex compared to Scheme due to its object-oriented nature and strict syntax rules. Beginners might find it challenging to grasp concepts like classes, objects, and inheritance.

Scheme: Scheme is designed to be simple and elegant. It has a minimalistic syntax and supports functional programming paradigms, making it easier for beginners to understand and use. Scheme code is often shorter and more straightforward compared to Java.

Orthogonality:

Java: Java has good orthogonality in terms of its object-oriented features. It provides a wide range of tools and libraries for various tasks, making it versatile for different applications. However, its syntax and type system can sometimes feel restrictive.

Scheme: Scheme is highly orthogonal, meaning that its features are orthogonal and composable. It provides a small set of fundamental constructs that can be combined in powerful ways to solve complex problems. This simplicity and orthogonality contribute to Scheme's elegance and ease of use.

Writability:

Java: Java offers good writability due to its rich set of libraries and tools, which allows developers to write code efficiently for a wide range of applications. However, its verbose syntax and strict type system can sometimes make writing code more tedious compared to more expressive languages.

Scheme: Scheme excels in writability due to its simple syntax and powerful features like first-class functions and lexical scoping. Developers can write concise and expressive code in Scheme, making it easy to prototype and iterate solutions quickly.

In summary, while Java and Scheme are both powerful programming languages, they differ significantly in terms of readability, simplicity, orthogonality, and writability. Java is more verbose and complex, while Scheme is known for its simplicity, elegance, and expressiveness.
